# Resouces

## Tools

### Data preprocessing

- **[Imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/index.html)** - Imbalanced-learn (imported as imblearn) is an open source, MIT-licensed library relying on scikit-learn (imported as sklearn) and provides tools when dealing with classification with imbalanced classes.

### Machine learning

- **[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)** - Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.

- **[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=fr)** - TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

- **[Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/index)** - State-of-the-art Machine Learning for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models.

- **[Spacy](https://spacy.io/)** - spaCy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing.

- **[Stanza](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)** - Stanza is a collection of accurate and efficient tools for the linguistic analysis of many human languages. Starting from raw text to syntactic analysis and entity recognition, Stanza brings state-of-the-art NLP models to languages of your choosing.

- **[Skopt](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/)** - Scikit-Optimize, or skopt, is a simple and efficient library to minimize (very) expensive and noisy black-box functions. It implements several methods for sequential model-based optimization. skopt aims to be accessible and easy to use in many contexts.

- **[Rasa](https://rasa.com/)** - Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text and voice-based conversations.

### Dataviz

- **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)** - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)** - Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

- **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)** - Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs.

- **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/)** - D3 (or D3.js) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML.

### Data pipeline

- **[Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)** - Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines.

### MLOps

- **[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)** - MLflow is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

### Logs analyze

- **[ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack)** - Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.

### Application building

- **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** - FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

- **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)** - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.

- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/fr/)** - Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** - Streamlit lets you turn python data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.

- **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** - Build optimized websites quickly, focus on your content.
