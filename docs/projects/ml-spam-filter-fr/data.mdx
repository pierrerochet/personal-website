# 💎 Data used in the project

You can dowload the spam data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajnathpatel/multilingual-spam-data?resource=download)  
Author - [Raj Nath Patel](https://www.kaggle.com/rajnathpatel)

These are 5134 French text from emails, split into 3593 for training and 1541 for testing (30 %).

The original text was in English and Machine Translated to French. The dataset therefore contains some inconsistencies in meaning due to translation errors.

The data only provides the body of the email in raw text, which means that we do not have the sender email address or any other metadata.

Below an example:

> "En tant que client apprécié, je suis heureux de vous informer qu'à la suite d'un récent examen de votre Mob No. vous êtes récompensé avec un Prix Bonus £1500, appelez 09066364589"
