# ðŸª„ How to improve the project ?

### Use native French data

First, the use of native French data could improve post-deployment spam detection.

### More data and more features

Another good option would be to find email dataset with additional elements such as sender address, url, html code, attachments, etc. We believe that these elements would be instrumental in building very good features to discriminate against spam.

Depending on the data at our disposal, other algorithms would be required for training. For example, more complex methods based on neural networks should work better for inspecting attachements.

Combining these improvements could make a very powerful anti spam. But the project would also be much more difficult to develop.
